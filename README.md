# 1stProject
 J.Itamar's first repository

Local public repository C:\ItaRepoGitHub_01

I use this script to make my backups, so putting something useful in the first repository of the Git and GitHub course, instead of a simple "Hello World".

Repository created during a class!

That line I added directly to the remote GitHub site and to save, perform a Commit changes!
