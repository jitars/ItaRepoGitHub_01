# 1stProject
 *J.Itamar's first repository*

Local public repository **C:\ItaRepoGitHub_01**

I use this script to make my backups on external HD, so putting something useful in the first repository, instead of a simple "Hello World".

Repository created during a class of the Git and GitHub course!

That line I added directly to the remote GitHub site and to save, perform a Commit changes!
